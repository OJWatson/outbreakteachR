#' Discrete in time SIR simulator
#'
#' \code{discrete_SIR_simulator} takes output of \code{first_infection_list} and
#' \code{outbreak_dataset_read} and simulates a discrete time SIR epidemic time
#' series using a user-provided R0, population size (N), number of initial seed
#' infections (I) and time of seeding (seed.hour). The simulation uses a poisson
#' distribrution to describe the number of secondary cases, the generation times
#' and recovery times. The mean for the secondary cases is equal to R0, and the
#' mean for the generation and recovery times is calculated from the user-provided
#' first_infection_list and outbreak.dataset.
#'
#' @param R0 Reproductive number. Default = 1.8
#' @param N Total population size. If NULL (default) then the total population
#' is the same as the provided datasets.
#' @param I Number of initial seed infections. Default = 3
#' @param seed.hour Hour at which seeding of epidemic begins. Default = 9
#' @param first_infection_list Infection list outputted by \code{first_infection_list}
#' @param outbreak.dataset Outbreak dataset outputted by \code{outbreak_dataset_read}
#' @param sampling Boolean determining if recovery and generation times should be sampled
#' from the observed or drawn fro a poisson with mean equal to mean of the observed.
#' Default = FALSE (poisson draws used)
#' @param exponential Boolean determining if infection is exponential or not. If
#' FALSE (Default) then the number of secondary infections from an individual is
#' takes into account S/N
